# The Distribution of PM 2.5 in San Francisco and its Relationship with Ashtma Hospitalization Rates&nbsp;&nbsp;


## Asthma
In 2017, Asthma related complications resulted in an estimated 1.6 million emerency departments visits throughout the country. The prevalence of ashtma among the United States population was about %8 in 2018. While there has been a decrease in trend on asthma among children, there continues to be inequities that influence asthma related outcomes. According to surveys by the CDC, asthma prevalence was found to be higher among families with a family income of <100% of the federal poverty line. 

## Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5)
Partiuclate matter is a source of air pollution that has shown to have adverse health effects on human health. Emissions of PM2.5 come from a variety of sources such as cars, trucks, industrical industries and other activities involving combustion. Research has shown that particulate matter can excarcerbate pre-exisitng conditions in the heart and lungs. California is one of the states that has 6 counties currently violating the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) standard. Furthermore, research has also shown the inequities in health outcomes due to exposure to PM2.5 in vulnerable populations such children, pregnant women and communities of color. There are risk factors that puts individuals and commnunities at greater risk for exposure to PM2.5 that can increase their risk for adverse health outcomes. 

## Environmental Injustice
The topic of environmental health has over time focused on environmental health injustices that have been impacted by historical policies and segregation throughout the country. Research has shown that communities of color have been impactd by exposure to environmental burdens at a higher rate than their white counterparts. In addition, study findings have shown that people of color are disproportionately exposed to PM2.5 due to risk factors such as living in proximity to major roadways which has shown to increase the occurrence of chronic respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, research has identified that race is a strong predictor of environmental burdens compared to other risk factors. Overall, there continues to be efforts by the state to mitigate the risk of environmental impacts on communities of color such as the development of the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 tool. In addition, community movements have also raised awareness of the cumulative health impacts of these environmental burdens.

### Assessing the distribution of Age-Adjusted Asthma Hospitalization Rates by San Francisco Zip Codes

After assessing the distribution of age-adjusted ashtma hospitalization rates by SF zip codes we identified 4 zip codes of interest:
- 94103: South of Market
- 94124: Hunters Point
- 94110: Inner Mission
- 94134: Portola
In the following maps, we visually compared the location of these neighborhoods in relation to PM2.5 concentrations, asthma hospitalization rates and percentage of minority populations by neighborhood.

### Correlation Plot: Assessing Correlation between Ashtma Related Emergecny Department Visits by PM2.5 Concentrations in San Francisco

While the correlation plot has scaterred points we can assess a positive trend of PM2.5 concentration and asthma related emergency department visits. While we can't drive inference based on this plot, it allows us to further explore the topic of these two variables.  

### Correlation Plot: Asthma Related Emergency Department Visits by PM2.5 Concentrations Stratified by Race/Ethnicity

This plot was stratified by ethnicity to see if there was any correlation between race/ethnicity and out variables of interest. There was no significant correlation between our variables but there was a positive trend for asthma related emergency department visits and PM2.5 concentrations in Hispanic and African American populations. This is in par with the current literature regarding the disproportionate exposures to environmental burdens on communities of color.
