# The Distribution of PM 2.5 in San Francisco and its Relationship with Ashtma Hospitalization Rates

## Asthma
In 2017, Asthma related complications resulted in an estimated 1.6 million emerency departments visits throughout the country. The prevalence of ashtma among the United States population was about %8 in 2018. While there has been a decrease in trend on asthma among children, there continues to be inequities that influence asthma related outcomes. According to surveys by the CDC, asthma prevalence was found to be higher among families with a family income of <100% of the federal poverty line. 

## Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5)
Partiuclate matter is a source of air pollution that has shown to have adverse health effects on human health. Emissions of PM2.5 come from a variety of sources such as cars, trucks, industrical industries and other activities involving combustion. Research has shown that particulate matter can excarcerbate pre-exisitng conditions in the heart and lungs. California is one of the states that has 6 counties currently violating the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) standard. Furthermore, research has also shown the inequities in health outcomes due to exposure to PM2.5 in vulnerable populations such children, pregnant women and communities of color. There are risk factors that puts individuals and commnunities at greater risk for exposure to PM2.5 that can increase their risk for adverse health outcomes. 

## Environmental Injustice
The topic of environmental health has over time focused on environmental health injustices that have been impacted by historical policies and segregation throughout the country. Research has shown that communities of color have been impactd by exposure to environmental burdens at a higher rate than their white counterparts. In addition, study findings have shown that people of color are disproportionately exposed to PM2.5 due to risk factors such as living in proximity to major roadways which has shown to increase the occurrence of chronic respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, research has identified that race is a strong predictor of environmental burdens compared to other risk factors. Overall, there continues to be efforts by the state to mitigate the risk of environmental impacts on communities of color such as the development of the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 tool. In addition, community movements have also raised awareness of the cumulative health impacts of these environmental burdens.
